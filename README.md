This script adds realistic weapon recoil by applying camera shake and vertical camera movement when firing a weapon.

Each shot slightly moves the camera upward to simulate vertical recoil, combined with configurable camera shake for a more immersive shooting experience.
An optional vehicle recoil feature applies adjusted recoil behavior while shooting from vehicles.
